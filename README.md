# Introduction to Bash

[Bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) is an acronym for **B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell, and is the main command line tool in linux/unix Operating Systems. `.sh` is the bash script default file extension.

- `#!` is called **shebang**, and is mandatory to place in bash script followed by the bash path
  - `echo $SHELL` to get the path of the bash
- `man command` to get help about any command
- `read` command
  - `-p` to display and read in the same line
  - `-a` to take array as input
  - `$REPLY` to read the output from read
- `diff` command to find difference between two files
- `env | grep SHELL` to find environment variables
  - `grep` command is to find something in long text/output
- use `export myVar=Hello` to add to the environment variable
- All arithmetic operations needs to be placed between `(())`
- array is defined as `arr=(1 2 3 4 5 6)`, and has following properties
  - To access any element: `${arr[3]}`
  - To get the whole array: `${arr[@]}`
  - To get the array length: `${#arr[@]}`
  - To get the array indexes: `${!arr[@]}`

## `echo` Command

- `-n` to display the output at the same line
- `-e` to include escape line characters like `\t`, `\n` etc

Brace expansion, also called alternation, is a feature copied from the C shell. It generates a set of alternative combinations. Generated results need not exist as files. The results of each expanded string are not sorted and left to right order is preserved:

```bash
$ echo a{p,c,d,b}e
ape ace ade abe
$ echo {a,b,c}{d,e,f}
ad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf
```

When brace expansion is combined with wildcards, the braces are expanded first, and then the resulting wildcards are substituted normally. Hence, a listing of JPEG and PNG images in the current directory could be obtained using:

```bash
ls _.{jpg,jpeg,png} # expands to _.jpg _.jpeg _.png - after which, # the wildcards are processed
echo \*.{png,jp{e,}g} # echo just show the expansions - # and braces in braces are possible.
```

In addition to alternation, brace expansion can be used for sequential ranges between two integers or characters separated by double dots. Newer versions of Bash allow a third integer to specify the increment.

```bash
echo {1..10}
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
echo {01..10}
# 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10
echo file{1..4}.txt
# file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt
echo {a..e}
# a b c d e
echo {1..10..3}
# 1 4 7 10
echo {a..j..3}
# a d g j
```

When brace expansion is combined with variable expansion (A.K.A. parameter expansion and parameter substitution) the variable expansion is performed after the brace expansion, which in some cases may necessitate the use of the eval built-in, thus:

```bash
start=1; end=10
echo {$start..$end}  # fails to expand due to the evaluation order
# {1..10}
eval echo {$start..$end} # variable expansion occurs then resulting string is evaluated
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
